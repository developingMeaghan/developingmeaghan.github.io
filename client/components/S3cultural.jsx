                                This is a term that was coined by researchers Peter Salavoy and John Mayer. 
                                To be emotionally intelligent means the individually is aware of an can 
                                manage their own emotions, positive and negative, as well as the emotions of others.

                            <p>
                                The difference between the two is that intelligence is defined as having these abilities:
                            </p>

                            <ul>

                                <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
                                <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
                                <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
                                <li>Working memory and short term memory</li>
                                <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                Where as emotional intelligence is defined as having these abilities:
                            </p>

                            <ul>

                                <li>Identifying emotions</li>
                                <li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
                                <li>Controlling ones own emotions</li>
                                <li>Perceiving how others feel</li>
                                <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication</li>
                                <li>Relating to others</li>
                                
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                As you can see the difference between the two is that intelligence is more world and skill based. 
                                Emotional intelligence is more focused on the self and others, and how to use emotions to connect 
                                with others.
                            </p>

                            <h2>why is Emotional Intelligence Important?</h2>

                            <p>
                                Emotional intelligence is important because it's essential to everyday life and can help us create a 
                                balanced life. By being able to recognize our negative emotions, for example stress. It can improve our 
                                physical wellbeing hugely as we can take the necessary actions to deal with it, and prevent the 
                                negative effects it has on our bodies and lives.
                                <br /> 
                                Recognizing other emotions like anxiety or depression allows us to seek help or figure out a solution 
                                which greatly improves our mental health, having a high emotional intelligence can also lead to a more positive attitude. 
                                <br />
                                Emotional intelligence can also help us build better relationships because with it we can express ourselves in more 
                                constructive ways and be able to relate to how others fee,l as well as understand their needs. 
                                <br />
                                It also helps in conflict resolution, those with a higher emotional intelligence find it easier to discern people's emotions 
                                and empathize with their perspective. This makes it easier to resolve conflict or even avoid them all together. Being more emotionally 
                                intelligent also helps to build stronger bonds in the workplace an help identify the needs of fellow co-workers.
