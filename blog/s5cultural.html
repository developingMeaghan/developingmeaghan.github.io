                        <h2>My Opinion of Core Skills:</h2>

                        <p>
                                I was surprised by the fact that everything we were learning was basically common sense, or at 
                                least they were in my household. They were things that my parents were always telling me whenever 
                                I encountered problems or moving forward in life. But what was challenging was trying to apply them 
                                to life consciously or in the moment. Because I would just get so caught in the moment and get bad 
                                tunnel vision but I think with time the aspects from core will come easily.  
                        </p>


                        <p>
                                I think we are focusing on core learning because it is a huge part of what companies are looking 
                                for in potential employers. Core is a lot of human skills and problem solving skills and I think 
                                that's important to have. Someone could be an excellent coder but be a complete dick and 
                                nobody wants that in their work space. Companies are looking for likable, skilled and problem 
                                solving people. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                                I think the time spent on core is important because it helps set people up for the work space we are 
                                going in. It teaches us to realize we are human and we can still learn and grow our minds. For some 
                                this is completely foreign and for others it's a good a reminder
