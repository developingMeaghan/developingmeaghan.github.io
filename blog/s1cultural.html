                <h1>Identities, Values, Strengths and Everything Else!</h1>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <h2>Core Values </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Kindness</li>
                        <li>Honesty</li>
                        <li>Caring</li>
                        <li>Loyalty</li>
                        <li>Acceptance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These values are huge in my life as they play a role in almost all my day 
                        to day decisions. Most of them are culturally influenced as well as life 
                        experience influenced.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <h2>Culture and Its Impact on My Values:</h2>
                        <p>The values I gained through my culture are honesty, caring and loyalty. Being 
                        from South Africa a country which is heavily Christian these values made 
                        their way into my life, mostly because my parents while I was growing up were faithful 
                        believers (I for the record am not) and therefore they would teach me the value of honesty 
                        and loyalty to your family, which naturally caring stemmed from. The rest of my values I 
                        gained from general living but most of them stemmed from being caring.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <h2>Ethical Situation That Displayed My Values:</h2>
                        <p>An ethical situation where my values came into play, and do almost every time I work, is 
                        when I was at work. I shouldered the responsibility of something not going through up standard, 
                        which doesn't impact anything unless we go to court. I did admit to both my customer and my 
                        boss, the customer felt bad. But at the time they were dealing with their 2 tired kids so 
                        I just wanted to make it easier and quicker for them. I did the necessary after math without 
                        a complaint as I knew it was just a part of the process and knew it was my own fault.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <h2>Strengths and Limitations!</h2>
                        <p>A strength of mine is being able to work under pressure, this works in my favor because I can 
                        keep cool head when problems arise or when time starts to run out on me. If all else fails I accept 
                        the result and identify what I could have done better or even potential fixes if possible, I'm always 
                        constantly learning from my mistakes and how to better myself. A limitation would have to be my 
                        stubbornness. If I do encounter problems I sometimes have a bad habit of fixating on the one thing and 
                        trying to figure out what has gone wrong there, rather than looking at the bigger picture to see if there 
                        isn't a problem there.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <h2>Culture and Its Impact on My Strengths and Limitations</h2>
                            <p>My culture is a culture of hard workers, from a young age we are taught that to get anywhere in our 
                            country we need to work hard. Schools never really went easy on us, they taught us to stay focused, 
                            cool and collected as it was going to be a tool we would need in adulthood. Our goal was to deal with 
                            task at hand from start to finish, something our parents drill into us as well. They tell us what is the 
                            point of reacting it's not going to fix or help the situation, and that there's no going home till 
                            the task is done. This is why I can stay calm during high pressure situations but is also the reason why 
                            I fixate on problems as it's been drilled into me that I need to finish the task and in the moment it's an obstacle.</p>
