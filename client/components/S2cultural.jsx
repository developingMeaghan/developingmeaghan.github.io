                            When I start working on something I become very focused and it's 
                            very hard to break this. I can go for hours before my brain eventually 
                            needs a little break to take care of basic human needs and even then 
                            jumping back into work isn't hard. This can be countered by my procrastination 
                            though, this only occurs when I'm not sure in what I'm suppose to be doing, 
                            or I'm not confident in what I'm doing. During the procrastination mode 
                            if people socialize with me my brain no longer wants to do work and will do 
                            anything to keep the conversation going, which furthers the procrastination. I 
                            do however work really well under pressure as I have been taught not to react 
                            and to take control of the situation as best as I can to reach my end goal. This 
                            is in both high stress and time constrained situations.

                        <h2>The Commitment!</h2>

                        <p>
                            I'll commit myself to doing bursts of EDA work with bursts of life tasks in-between, 
                            this will prevent any procrastination or distractions. I will be sure to juggle in-order 
                            of urgency. I'll seek help from my facilitator or fellow students after exhausting all 
                            resources on the internet and self attempts, if that time exceeds half an hour. I'll do 
                            so by using the slack communication app or email if possible.  I'll be sure to fulfill my 
                            work duties and make sure I have my EDA work under control before taking on anything extra 
                            in both work and social aspects. To combat my procrastination I'll push myself to do short 
                            burst of work and work my way up in length of time.

                        <p>
                            I expect the facilitation team to give me answers to questions I have regarding the course and
                            to help me out as much as they can when I encounter a problem. The reason behind this is 
                            because I have more than likely already googled it in a million different ways and have 
                            come up dry. I expect them to be understanding of any situations I find myself in and 
                            to offer nothing but kindness with obvious exceptions.
