                <h1>The Multiple Powers of Positioning and Their Individual Effects.</h1>
                <p>
                        The first thing to understand, before diving into the differences 
                        between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning, is that every 
                        element on a web page is seen as a box or block. 
                        Here's an image for clarification:
                </p>

                <img src="images/boxified.png" alt="Example of website boxified" id="dogs">

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>
                            This is important to note because it helps us understand how positioning works 
                            and the different specification we can apply to it. When it comes to wanting move 
                            things we can specify which box we want to move or position. We can do this in CSS 
                            after specifying what it is we want to move with the position tag. There are all together 
                            4 different values of position tags: <strong>static, relative, absolute</strong> and <strong>fixed.</strong>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>
                            <strong>Static</strong> is the default setting for every element on a page. This value is only ever used when 
                            an element is receiving style for perhaps a different element or is being impacted by another element 
                            to return it to its original default. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>
                            To make an element <strong>relative</strong> means we can move it around from its original default spot, it is relative to itself. 
                            However, when we use this value we have to specify with attribute if we want to move left, right, top (up) or bottom 
                            (down) from its original spot or it will remain static. This value gives us a lot of control and is very helpful when 
                            wanting to make small changes. It also allows us to use z-index which isn't possible with the static value. The z-index 
                            refers to the stacking order of elements and how they appear and flow, the greater the z-index, the higher its is in the 
                            order, the sooner it's seen. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>
                            The third value of position is <strong>absolute.</strong> With this value we can set the exact location of where we want our element using 
                            attributes left right top and bottom again. This time it uses the positioning of the next relative or absolute parent 
                            element to move around rather than its original position, if there is no parent element that's relative or absolute the 
                            attributes will position relative to the html page itself. (Think of a parent element as a box around another box, the 
                            box inside is a child to the outer box.) This value doesn't get impacted by other elements, the downside to this is that 
                            can kill the flow and flexibility of our page making styling even harder.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class ="paragraph">
                    <p>
                            Finally the last value that can be used in CSS is <strong>fixed.</strong> This value is very rarely used, it was more common when webpages were 
                            first being created, Everything on a webpage was either static or fixed since they were usually designed for computers and not other devices. But 
                            the value can be useful, what it does is fix the element relative to the viewport (a viewport is the users visible area of the web page.) This means 
                            when someone scrolls on the page the element will not move it will stay right where it has been fixed, as if its been glued. A good example of 
                            this would be a navigation/ menu bar that stays either where it has been positioned, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">this site</a>a shows this really well. 
                            Where as you can see this current site you're reading this on the navigation/menu bar moves and eventually disappears when you scroll.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>
                            To summarize the relative value allows us to move an element around from its original default position using attributes. The absolute value allows us 
                            to set the exact location of an element using the parent element as its original point. And the fixed position basically superglues the element to that 
                            one part of the webpage viewport never to move ever. But lets not forget static which is always applied to all elements, this is it's original 
                            default positioning without any values or tags being applied to it.
                    </p>
