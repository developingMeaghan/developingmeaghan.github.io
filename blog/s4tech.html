                        <h2>Not My Proudest Moment...</h2>
                        <p>
                            A simple problem I got stuck on, which was a common problem I encountered, was on the second 
                            kata I was doing. I had to define a property of an array as an object. Basically I had to give 
                            a description to an item in a list. I knew exactly how to do it and in my excitement to do it 
                            I miss spelt the variable, the name of the list because you need to specify what you are working 
                            on before you can start doing any changes. But I didn't see the mistake and when the test told me 
                            it was a fail I just assumed I didn't get it right. So I spent hours and hours trying alternative 
                            ways, which weren't working. I googled it and my original answer just kept coming up. So I tried 
                            my original way, again, and it didn't work, again. So I decided to use the rubber duck method of 
                            problem solving. This is where you take a rubber duck and explain to it your code and what it is 
                            suppose to do and in doing so it allows you to see everything and not the small part you're focusing 
                            on. So I grabbed my rubber duck, Marvin, and I started explaining my code to him and that’s where I 
                            noticed that I had been spelling the variable wrong. The whole process was very frustrating, I felt 
                            like I had been going in circles for hours, but figuring out the mistake and getting it right made 
                            cry tears of joy. I learnt that I should always check my spelling and any small finiky things, and 
                            to maybe talk to Marvin first, before I try alternative code. I also learnt multiple ways to define 
                            a property of an array as an object.

                        <h2>Problem solving Methods and Where I stand With them:</h2>

                        <ul>

                            <li>Pseudocode: Semi-confident, I don't do it at first, I tend to just jump into coding because I feel like I know what I need to do. But then part of the way I forget what needs to come next or get confused. Only then do I start using this method.</li>
                            <li>Trying something: Pretty confident, when problems arise I usually start changing  random things to see where the problem is or see if it fixes it.</li>
                            <li>Rubber ducky method: Very confident, this has been my go to method for when a problem comes up. I tend to get really bad tunnel vision so this helps with that by looking at the bigger picture instead of focusing on the small problem. </li>
                            <li>Reading error messages: not overly confident, sometimes they don't make a whole lot of sense to me.</li>
                            <li>Console.logging: I haven't used this method as I'm not confident in it at all.</li>
                            <li>Googling: very confident, it has been my saving grace for when I get really stuck or don’t understand something.</li>
                            <li>Asking your peers for help: very confident, I have asked a peer for help and they have sort of been the go to person when I want help from someone in the course. It's been great working things out together and having someone to help me.</li>
                            <li>Asking coaches for help: very confident, I haven't had to do so this sprint but I got pretty close. However, my peer could help so I didn't need to.</li>
                            <li>Improving your process with reflection: very confident, after resolving my problems I look at the mistakes I made evaluate how to avoid them in the future.</li>
                        </ul>
