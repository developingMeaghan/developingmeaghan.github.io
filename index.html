             <p>My name is Meaghan De Klerk, I have no idea what I am doing with my life, but what I do know is that I have passion
              for coding and that I would love to do something with it as a career. I am originally from South Africa but now 
              call Wellington, New Zealand home. I have a huge love for music and collecting vinyls. I also have a big love for gaming
              and creating art. 
              <br>
              Travelling is also a huge interest but is also the reason why I decided to pursue web development, 
              as there are many places around the world looking for developers and therefore a tool in getting to see the world.
              I want to experience everything the world has to offer or as much as I can during my time on this big rock hurling through space.
