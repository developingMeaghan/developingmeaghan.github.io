                        <h2>Your Brain is Plastic and Here's Why That's Good.</h2>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Neuroplasticity</strong> is the idea that the brain can form new connections and 
                            adapt to our situations. It does this by strengthening pathways through 
                            various activities. Understanding the benefits of neuroplasticity can 
                            help us to better ourselves in areas we want to improve in. Neuroplasticity 
                            is all about the idea that by strengthening our neuron pathways we can improve 
                            on any skill, even the ones we think we are a complete lost cause on. It also 
                            gives hope to those who have suffered from strokes or traumatic brain injuries 
                            as neuroplasticity indicates that they will be able to relearn everything they 
                            can no longer do due to those events and be able to have a good quality of life. 
                            It's just a matter of practicing that skill over and over again and putting it to 
                            use to strengthen the neuron pathways. 
                        </p>

                        <h2>Neuroplasticity and Me.</h2>

                        <p>
                            I'd engage with neuroplasticity by practicing Java a lot more to understand it and get 
                            a handle on it. I would also carry out the actions mentally when I don't have the time 
                            to physically do it and see how much I can remember. By doing so I'll be able to become 
                            the web developer I aspire to be, using this understanding of neuroplasticity to approach 
                            my weaknesses rather than avoiding them and altering my goals to avoid them. Not just 
                            for becoming the best web developer I can be but in all aspects of my life to be the best 
                            version of my self that I can be.

                        <h2>Ways to Improve Neuroplasticity:</h2>

                        <p>
                            Working on our neuron pathways and expanding our neuroplasticity isn't that hard at all, we can do so by:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                        
                            <li>Simply practicing and working on the desired skill we want to master.</li>
                            <li>Doing the activity so often that it can be done with our eyes closed.</li>
                            <li>Even if there's no time to physically do the task, simply doing the activity in our head as if we were 
                                physically doing it, strengthens those pathways in the brain</li>
                            <li>Travelling can also help build pathways as it throws unknown stimuli at us as well as a new environment
                                opening new pathways and activity in the brain. </li>
                            <li>Learning a new instrument, increases connectivity in brain regions and opens new pathways. </li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Mindset</strong> refers to understanding that abilities understanding can be developed. That you can improve your 
                            intelligence and develop skills by simply putting in effort. It's relevant because by having this mindset nothing 
                            is impossible, you don't need to have a talent in something to be able to explore it or go after it in a career. 
                            So long as the passion to do it and the passion to learn is there then the individual will go far.

                            If I ever reach a moment where I feel like I can't learn a coding language or wrap my head around a coding language, 
                            because I feel like its beyond my abilities, I'll take a breather and remind myself that I am more than just my baseline 
                            talents. That this is something I can develop over time and master. I'll focus my energy on working on those aspects 
                            rather than giving up on my big goal.  I'll ask questions when I'm unsure even if they seem really basic and stupid.
